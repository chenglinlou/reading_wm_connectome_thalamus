Code for the study on associations between connectome-wise features on the thalamus and reading abilities in children.

Execute corr_run.m to perform network preprocessing and statistic analyses.
  brain_reading_corr for correlations between reading measures and two network measures (local efficiency and clustering coefficient)
  main_BRW_LAU2_glob_lambda is the code from Avena-Koenigsberger et al. (2019) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006833), which computes routing strategy matrices.
  following code averages transmissional cost across all lambda values defined in main_BRW_LAU2_glob_lambda, and perform correlation tests between reading measures and cost
